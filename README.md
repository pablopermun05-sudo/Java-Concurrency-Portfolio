### 🛠️ Technical Overview

| Project | Key Technologies | Problem Solved |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01-Parking-Sync** | `wait()`, `notify()`, `notifyAll()` | Thread synchronization for a smart parking system with capacity constraints. |
| **02-Traffic-Control** | `java.util.concurrent.Semaphore` | Managing access and flow control in a winery unloading zone using semaphores. |
| **03-Thread-Pools** | `ExecutorService`, `ThreadPool` | Resource optimization for concurrent task handling in a multi-queue scenario. |
| **04-Bridge-Logic** | `ReentrantLock`, `Conditions` | Safety-constrained bidirectional flow control on a bridge structure. |
| **05-RMI-Parking** | `Java RMI` | Implementation of a remote access and priority management system for parking. |
| **06-JCSP-Parking** | `JCSP Library`, `Channels` | Concurrency control through message-passing and virtual channel communication. |

### 🚀 Highlights
* **Graphical Feedback:** Every project includes a **Java Swing Canvas** for real-time visualization of thread states.
* **Design Patterns:** Proper use of **Runnable** vs **Thread** and implementation of priority-based logic.
